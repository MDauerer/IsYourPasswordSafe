What makes a password safe?
- Use 9 or more characters
- Don't do common substitutions such as e = 3 or i = 1
- Use a mix of letters(upper- and lowercase), numbers and special characters
- Don't use the same password (or variations of it) more than once


This Programm is using the hashlib library in python and the haveibeenpwned api to check if your password is secure 
Also using the getpass library to not show the input because a password is sensetive information
